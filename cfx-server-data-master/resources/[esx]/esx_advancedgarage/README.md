# KNOWN BUGS:
* There is a Limit on how many Vehicles that can be in each garage. For me it was 36 Vehicles in the Car Garage but after that i couldn't pull anymore out. You can still buy more Boats & Planes if the Car Garage is at 36.
* It is Possible to Duplicate Vehicles but do note that if said Person Duplicates a Vehicle & takes 1 of them & sell thems the other one is useless & can NOT be stored or sold.
* Doesn't work well when using the Car Dealer Job.
* If you are having problems with the SQL from esx_vehicleshop try the SQL from here. If a problem with the SQL from here try esx_vehicleshop SQL. If still having problems please submit an issue.
